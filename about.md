This website was made using a template from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net), but has been adapted to use liquid and jekyll. This has been done so that it can be run on Github Pages. The purpose of this site is to make a semi-useful web presence for myself and, more importantly, to learn some web-dev skills.
