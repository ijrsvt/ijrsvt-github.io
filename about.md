This website is a mix between a real production site and an experimental testbed. I am learning some basic web-dev skills by creating this website. This means, unfortunately, that updates are sporadic and certain elements will not look as seemless as they could be. If I wanted a purely aesthetic website, I would go to some site-building website (i.e. Squarespace).

This website was made using a template from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net), but has been adapted to use liquid and jekyll. This has been done so that it can be run on Github Pages.
